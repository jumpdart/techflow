# techflow

This is just straight JS to view json data that shows relationships between Employer/Project/Technology

The intent is to ultimately have the technologies that have been worked on the longes will be represented as larger nodes in the force graph.

With this force graph, a developer can add this library and act on the selected employer/project/tech.

TODO wishlist:
- filter ability
  - somehow gray out or hide nodes based on used params
- logo nodes
  - this would be super cool to have svgs for the technologies that were logos so that a user would not need to interact with a node to know what it is
